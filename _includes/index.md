## Priorities

While hacking, please keep in mind these priorities, in order of importance:

1. Listen and learn
2. Share knowledge and techniques
3. Try new things and gain new knowledge/insights
4. Have fun/team building
5. Produce usable code or demos

Priorities #1-4 are **essential**.  Priority #5 would be nice to have.

## Goals 💯

## Teams

Group should be split into three teams working in 1-2 hour sprints on a given task. Teams will check in for 5-15 minutes between each sprint to see where things are at and plan next tasks.

Teams should strive to hack together, on a single machine at a time.  The driver role should rotate every 20-30 minutes and each member should drive at least once per sprint.

Members should feel free to change team membership or reorganize teams as needed during the hack day.
