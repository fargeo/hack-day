## Priorities

While hacking, please keep in mind these priorities, in order of importance:

1. Listen and learn
2. Share knowledge and techniques
3. Try new things and gain new knowledge/insights
4. Have fun/team building
5. Produce usable code, prototypes or demos

Priorities #1-4 are **essential**.  Priority #5 would be nice to have.

## Goals 💯

For this hack trip, we are going to be exploring a variety of tracks (three to start), each with its own goal.

1. Prototype an Arches Esri FeatureService using Koop.js
1. Prototype an ArcGIS Pro add-in for accessing Arches resource instance data via API
1. Improve performance of the arches business data import routine

## Teams

Group should be split into three (or four) teams working in 1-2 hour sprints on a given task. Teams will check in for 5-15 minutes between each sprint to see where things are at and plan next tasks.

Here are the initial team assignments:
1. **Prototype an Arches Esri FeatureService using Koop.js**: Ryan, Rob, Dennis
1. **Prototype an ArcGIS Pro add-in for accessing Arches resource instance data via API**: Namjun, Adam, Cyrus
1. **Improve performance of the arches business data import routine**: Galen, Alexei

Each team should strive to hack together, on a single machine at a time.  The driver role should rotate every 20-30 minutes and each member should drive at least once per sprint.

Members should feel free to change team membership or reorganize teams as needed during the hack day.

## Code organization

Coding for items **1** & **2** will be done in branches of the [`fargeo/salinas`](https://github.com/fargeo/salinas) repo.

Each team will code in a separate branch, merging into `master` as needed.

Core Arches development work will be done in branches of the [`fargeo/arches` fork](https://github.com/fargeo/arches).

Instead of cloning the `fargeo/arches` fork, it is probably much easier to just [change remote](#preparation) on your existing local arches repo.

After the trip, you can change your Arches repo's remote back with the following command:
```
git remote set-url origin https://github.com:archesproject/arches.git
```

## Preparation

Please do the following before arriving:

- re-read this page (it's being updated daily)
- add or suggest food/drink places and/or activities (below)
- if possible, bring adapters and cables (esp. HDMI) to connect your laptop to house TVs

- change your arches repo remote to point to [`fargeo/arches`](https://github.com/fargeo/arches) and checkout the `salinas` branch by running the following:
```
git remote set-url origin https://github.com:fargeo/arches.git
git fetch
git checkout salinas
```

- clone the [`fargeo/salinas`](https://github.com/fargeo/salinas) repo


## Food

Since we're in Salinas this time, most of the meals will be catered, but for dinner on Thursday and lunch on Friday were going to be on our own, so we'll need to pick destinations in/around Salinas for those meals.  Here are some options:
