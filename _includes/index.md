## Priorities

While hacking, please keep in mind these priorities, in order of importance:

1. Listen and learn
2. Share knowledge and techniques
3. Try new things and gain new knowledge/insights
4. Have fun/team building
5. Produce usable code, prototypes or demos

Priorities #1-4 are **essential**.  Priority #5 would be nice to have.

## Goals üíØ

For this hack trip, we are going to be exploring three tracks, each with its own set of goals.
1. **Create arches application to replace mapbox-gl-js with MapLibre**
    - Goals:
        - Create an arches application to drop-in replace current Arches front-end mapping components
        - Replace all Mapbox GL JS usage with MapLibre
        - Create a migration to swap out any Mapbox services with free services such as OpenFreeMap
        - (Stretch goal) Upgrade to the latest MapLibre (not directly Mapbox GL JS compatible), and replacing Knockout usage with VueJS
        - (Stretch goal) Encapsulating **all** Arches mapping capabilities into the new Arches Mapping Application (back-end)
    - Reading:
        - [MapLibre "MapBox migration guide"](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/guides/mapbox-migration-guide/)
        - [OpenFreeMap](https://openfreemap.org/quick_start/)
2. **Python/Go Compare Arches Companion benchmarks to Arches, optimize arches based on companion implementation (resources API)**
    - Goals:
        - Comprehend Go implementation
        - Make optimizations to Arches (specifically focusing on resources API) based on these insights
        - (Stretch goal) Implement Arches Companion as an arches application
        - Collaborate on optimization implementations with Group #3
    - Reading:
        - Python Global Interpreter lock
    - Need access to:
        - Arches Companion repo
3. **General performance improvements (N+1 queries, caching, psycopg 3, UUIDv7, add index to resourceid in edit log)**
    - Goals:
        - Starting with user pain points, identify areas in Arches for obvious performance improvements
        - Implement benchmarking to measure optimizations
        - Collaborate on optimization implementations with Group #2
    - Reading:
        - [Airspeed Velocity documentation](https://asv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
4. **Lessons/philosophizing on better resource forecasting (using Zoho or other tools)**
    - Goals:
        - How to better integrate long-term forecasting with project scoping & developing project scopes from resources in Zoho
        - How to compare forecasted time vs billed time, either as a Harvest+Zoho integration, or using Zoho to measure billed time
        - Identify metrics for determining when new team members need to be brought in
        - How to better integrate Zoho into Monday morning & Resource Allocation meetings
        - Philosophize about "top-down" (from PM's) and "bottom-up" (from Developers) for weekly time estimations
            - Identify an integration path (if any) for Github Projects & Zoho
    - Reading:
        - Any relevant readings here
    - Preparations:
        - Create a sandbox projects in Zoho and Harvest for testing integrations


At the conclusion of our work, each team should be prepared to briefly (15-30 minutes) present their results and findings to the other teams.

## Teams

Group should be split into three (or four) teams working in 1-2 hour sprints on a given task. Teams will check in for 5-15 minutes between each sprint to see where things are at and plan next tasks.

Here are the initial team assignments:

1. **Create arches application to replace mapbox-gl-js with MapLibre**
    - Christopher
    - Johnathan
    - Rob
2. **Python/Go Compare Arches Companion benchmarks to Arches, optimize arches based on companion implementation (resources API)**
    - Alexei
    - Jacob
    - Dennis
3. **General performance improvements (N+1 queries, caching, psycopg 3, UUIDv7, add index to resourceid in edit log)**
    - Aaron
    - Cyrus
    - Namjun
4. **Lessons/philosophizing on better resource forecasting (using Zoho or other tools)**
    - Adam
    - Alex
    - Peter
    - Dennis

Each team should strive to hack together, on a single machine as much as possible.  The driver role should rotate every 20-30 minutes and each member should drive at least once per sprint.

Members should feel free to change team membership or reorganize teams as desired during the hack.

## Code organization

Core Arches development work will be done in branches of the [`fargeo/arches` fork](https://github.com/fargeo/arches) and should target v8. We will be using the [Arches Lingo](https://github.com/archesproject/arches-lingo) project as our default project unless teams determine otherwise.

Instead of cloning the `fargeo/arches` fork, it is probably much easier to just [change remote](#preparation) on your existing local arches repo.

After the trip, you can change your Arches repo's remote back with the following command:
```
git remote set-url origin https://github.com:archesproject/arches.git
```

## Preparation

Please do the following before arriving:

- re-read this page (it's being updated daily)
- if possible, bring adapters and cables (esp. HDMI) to connect your laptop to TVs
- change your arches repo remote to point to [`fargeo/arches`](https://github.com/fargeo/arches) by running the following:
```
git remote set-url origin https://github.com:fargeo/arches.git
git fetch
```
- checkout the branches you will be working on (e.g. an Arches Application)
