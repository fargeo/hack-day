## Priorities

While hacking, please keep in mind these priorities, in order of importance:

1. Listen and learn
2. Share knowledge and techniques
3. Try new things and gain new knowledge/insights
4. Have fun/team building
5. Produce usable code for Arches

Priorities #1-4 are **essential**.  Priority #5 would be nice to have.

## Goals üíØ

The broad goal of this hack trip is to prototype some upcoming Arches features.

As with our last hack trip, we will be hacking on the the Arches code base (inside of [own special hacking fork](https://github.com/fargeo/arches)).

Our development goals for this trip are as follows:

1. BROAD GOAL:

    - DETAILS

## Teams

Group should be split into two teams running on parallel tracks pushing towards goals 1 & 2.

Hacking should be done in 1-2 hour sprints with teams checking in for 5-10 minutes between each sprint.

Teams should strive to hack together, on a single machine at a time.  The driver role should rotate every 20-30 minutes and each member should drive at least once per sprint.

If teams feel too large, we can establish a third team around goal 3 to break away from the other two teams.

Members should also feel free to change team membership during the hack day with the agreement of other team members.

Teams are as follows **(drag & drop your name onto a team to join)**:

<div data-bind="drop: {value: unassign}" style="margin-top:10px">
    <strong>Unassigned:</strong>
    <ul data-bind="foreach:unassignedTeam">
        <li data-bind="text:name, drag: {value: $data}" class="draggable"></li>
    </ul>
    <div class="drop-target">Unassign</div>
</div>

## Code organization

Coding will be done in branches of the [`fargeo/arches` fork](https://github.com/fargeo/arches).

Instead of cloning the `fargeo/arches` fork, it is probably much easier to just change remote on your existing arches (commands below under 'Preparation').

Each team will code in a separate branch, merging from each other as needed.

Following the trip, the Arches team will evaluate the value and viability of merging any code from these branches into `master`, and ultimately back into [`archesproject/arches`](https://github.com/archesproject/arches).

## Preparation

Please do the following before arriving:

- re-read this page (it's being updated daily)
- join a team above
- change remote on your local `arches` repo to or clone the [`fargeo/arches` fork](https://github.com/fargeo/arches) locally
    - to change remote, run: `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/fargeo/arches.git`
    - to clone, run: `git clone https://github.com/fargeo/arches.git` - you'll then need to set Arches up as you normally would

It's suggested that you read up a bit on the relevant technologies for the team that you'll be working on (see links above).
